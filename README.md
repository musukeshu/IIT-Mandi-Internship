# IIT-Mandi-Internship
It is a project on Landslide Susceptibility Zonation and Mapping using Machine Learning Approaches.
This project contains 4 datasets:
- Ring Dataset
- Spiral Dataset
- Interlock Dataset
- Landslide Dataset
#### Algorithms Used:
Multiple Machine learning algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, FDA, K-Means, KNN, etc and Artificial Neural Network model is used to assess the accuracy of each of these methods and to conclude which algorithm is best and for which dataset. This was my first machine learning project and almost all the models used and implemented from scratch without any use of inbuilt library.
#### To run the project
- Install MATLAB
- Each dataset is in a zip file and all the models applied are also in the same zip file.
- Then each each code from each zip file to see the results.
